listing and analyser tool.

# Features

### Seller dashboard

Never miss or forget your owned sneakers with having all details of
your bought and currently on-sale listings in
all-in-one seller dashboard.

### Analyse price trends

Receive latest sales data & market information so you could decide
if you should invest in the sneaker (or regret investing!).

### Find sales volume

Get real-time sneaker sales volumes in the most popular
sneaker reselling sites by using advanced API's that
provide you with in-depth market info, like bids and asks.

### Tokens system

API's that we are using do not like us unfortunately, so we have to keep our request count low. Therefore we have a token system that makes you think twice before spamming buttons!
